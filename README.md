Azure Service used : Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. The workflow of Azure Static Web Apps is tailored to a developer's daily workflow. Apps are built and deployed based off code changes. When you create an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to monitor a branch of your choice. Here to build this website I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
